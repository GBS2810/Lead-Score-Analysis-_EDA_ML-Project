# Lead-Score-Analysis-_EDA_ML-Project
Here, We build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score (.i.e 0-100) to each and every leads for targeting the potential &amp; hot leads by the Institution.


The following are the steps that we have used:
  
    1. Reading and Understanding of the Dataset
    2. Data Cleaning
    3. EDA â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis
    4. Data Preparation for Model Building
    5. Feature Scaling using Standard Scalar
    6. Train-Test Split of the data
    7. Feature Selections with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
    8. Model Building
    9. Model Evaluation
    10. Making Prediction on the Test data
    11.Final Observation/Conclusion
